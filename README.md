# TrajectoryMining
This project is about discovering General Co-movement Pattern from Large-scale Trajectories.

To facililate the large-scale needs, we use Apache-Spark as our solution platform. 
The current version of the project serves as the experimentary codes for our paper that will be published in VLDB'17. 
A user-friendly version is on the way, and we will also release a UI tool on Dec.
